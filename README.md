## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I created this project using HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox, and JavaScript. 
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the EmailJS API, which allowed me to       seamlessly send emails to users. 
- Additionally, I learned how to navigate users to a dedicated success message page after successfully submitting their email. 
- Leveraging JavaScript's localStorage feature, I efficiently stored temporary data, such as user emails, to personalize the success message page for a more user-friendly experience.
